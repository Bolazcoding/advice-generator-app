## Overview

- Advice Generator App
  A simple and interactive web application that fetches random advice from an external API. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### How it works

- When the "Generate Advice" button is clicked, the app makes a GET request to the Advice Slip API.

- The returned advice text is extracted and displayed dynamically on the page.
